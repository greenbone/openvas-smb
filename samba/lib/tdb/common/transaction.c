/*
  transaction design:

  - only allow a single transaction at a time per database. This makes
    using the transaction API simpler, as otherwise the caller would
    have to cope with temporary failures in transactions that conflict
    with other current transactions

  - keep the transaction recovery information in the same file as the
    database, using a special 'transaction recovery' record pointed at
    by the header. This removes the need for extra journal files as
    used by some other databases

  - dymacially allocated the transaction recover record, re-using it
    for subsequent transactions. If a larger record is needed then
    tdb_free() the old record to place it on the normal tdb freelist
    before allocating the new record

  - during transactions, keep a linked list of writes all that have
    been performed by intercepting all tdb_write() calls. The hooked
    transaction versions of tdb_read() and tdb_write() check this
    linked list and try to use the elements of the list in preference
    to the real database.

  - don't allow any locks to be held when a transaction starts,
    otherwise we can end up with deadlock (plus lack of lock nesting
    in posix locks would mean the lock is lost)

  - if the caller gains a lock during the transaction but doesn't
    release it then fail the commit

  - allow for nested calls to tdb_transaction_start(), re-using the
    existing transaction record. If the inner transaction is cancelled
    then a subsequent commit will fail
 
  - keep a mirrored copy of the tdb hash chain heads to allow for the
    fast hash heads scan on traverse, updating the mirrored copy in
    the transaction version of tdb_write

  - allow callers to mix transaction and non-transaction use of tdb,
    although once a transaction is started then an exclusive lock is
    gained until the transaction is committed or cancelled

  - the commit stategy involves first saving away all modified data
    into a linearised buffer in the transaction recovery area, then
    marking the transaction recovery area with a magic value to
    indicate a valid recovery record. In total 4 fsync/msync calls are
    needed per commit to prevent race conditions. It might be possible
    to reduce this to 3 or even 2 with some more work.

  - check for a valid recovery record on open of the tdb, while the
    global lock is held. Automatically recover from the transaction
    recovery area if needed, then continue with the open as
    usual. This allows for smooth crash recovery with no administrator
    intervention.

  - if TDB_NOSYNC is passed to flags in tdb_open then transactions are
    still available, but no transaction recovery area is used and no
    fsync/msync calls are made.
