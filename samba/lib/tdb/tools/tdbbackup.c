/*

  This program is meant for backup/restore of tdb databases. Typical usage would be:
     tdbbackup *.tdb
  when Samba shuts down cleanly, which will make a backup of all the local databases
  to *.bak files. Then on Samba startup you would use:
     tdbbackup -v *.tdb
  and this will check the databases for corruption and if corruption is detected then
  the backup will be restored.

  You may also like to do a backup on a regular basis while Samba is
  running, perhaps using cron.

  The reason this program is needed is to cope with power failures
  while Samba is running. A power failure could lead to database
  corruption and Samba will then not start correctly.

  Note that many of the databases in Samba are transient and thus
  don't need to be backed up, so you can optimise the above a little
  by only running the backup on the critical databases.
