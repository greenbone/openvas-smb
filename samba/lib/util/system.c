/*
   The idea is that this file will eventually have wrappers around all
   important system calls in samba. The aims are:

   - to enable easier porting by putting OS dependent stuff in here

   - to allow for hooks into other "pseudo-filesystems"

   - to allow easier integration of things like the japanese extensions

   - to support the philosophy of Samba to expose the features of
     the OS within the SMB model. In general whatever file/printer/variable
     expansions/etc make sense to the OS should be acceptable to Samba.
