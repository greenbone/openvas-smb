  PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE MODIFYING!

  This module is a general abstraction for the main select loop and
  event handling. Do not ever put any localised hacks in here, instead
  register one of the possible event types and implement that event
  somewhere else.

  There are 2 types of event handling that are handled in this module:

  1) a file descriptor becoming readable or writeable. This is mostly
     used for network sockets, but can be used for any type of file
     descriptor. You may only register one handler for each file
     descriptor/io combination or you will get unpredictable results
     (this means that you can have a handler for read events, and a
     separate handler for write events, but not two handlers that are
     both handling read events)

  2) a timed event. You can register an event that happens at a
     specific time.  You can register as many of these as you
     like. They are single shot - add a new timed event in the event
     handler to get another event.

  To setup a set of events you first need to create a event_context
  structure using the function event_context_init(); This returns a
  'struct event_context' that you use in all subsequent calls.

  After that you can add/remove events that you are interested in
  using event_add_*() and talloc_free()

  Finally, you call event_loop_wait_once() to block waiting for one of the
  events to occor or event_loop_wait() which will loop
  forever.
