This is the `smb` module for the OpenVAS Scanner. It includes libraries
(`openvas-wmiclient`/`openvas-wincmd`) to interface with Microsoft Windows
Systems through the Windows Management Instrumentation API and a `wmic`
binary to execute queries remotely on that system.

## Installation

This module can be configured, built and installed with following commands:

    cmake .
    make install

For detailed installation requirements and instructions, please see the file
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

If you are not familiar or comfortable building from source code, we recommend
that you use the Greenbone Security Manager TRIAL (GSM TRIAL), a prepared virtual
machine with a readily available setup. Information regarding the virtual machine
is available at <https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow>.

## History

This module is derived from a package distributed by Zenoss, Inc.,
named wmi-1.3.14. The original location was:
http://dev.zenoss.org/svn/trunk/inst/externallibs/wmi-1.3.14.tar.bz2

Since then, various special patches were applied for some needs of OpenVAS
Scanner. Also, anything not needed for OpenVAS Scanner was removed.

The Zenoss package actually was a copy of a code base of the Samba project
(https://www.samba.org/), forked based on the GPL v2 licensed status.
