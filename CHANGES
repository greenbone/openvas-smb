openvas-smb 1.0.0 (2015-02-09)

This is the first release of the openvas-smb module 1.0 for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment Systems (OpenVAS).

This release adds support for NTLMv2 to win_cmd_exec and includes the WMI
command line tool "wmic". It also removes included libraries and uses the system
libraries in their place and contains the result of several code cleanups.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Andre Heinecke.

Main changes compared to 1.0+beta2:
* Support for NTLMv2 has been added to win_cmd_exec.
* The WMI command line tool "wmic" has been added.
* Included heimdal libraries have been removed, openvas-smb uses the system
  libraries now.
* Included popt library has been removed, openvas-smb uses the system
  library now.
* Several clean ups to remove unused code and to improve quality in both code
  and build environment.
