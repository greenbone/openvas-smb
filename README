History:

This module is derived from a package distributed by Zenoss, Inc.,
named wmi-1.3.14. The original location was:
http://dev.zenoss.org/svn/trunk/inst/externallibs/wmi-1.3.14.tar.bz2

Since then, various special patches were applied for some needs of OpenVAS.
Also, anything not needed for OpenVAS was removed.

The Zenoss package actually was a copy of a code base of the Samba project
(https://www.samba.org/), forked based on the GPL v2 licensed status.
